  <p>Hi! I'm Jacob and this is my lab that I built to help me get more hands on experience inside of Azure. Below you'll find more information about me, and if you click on "About the Lab" it will take you to a breakdown of how this site and the snake game are hosted.</p>

<section id="about-me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a passionate Systems and Network Engineer with 7+ years of hands on experience supporting Military, Municipal, and private sector environments. My journey started at the helpdesk and grew into systems administration before moving up to full-time Systems Engineer and Project Engineer roles. 
    <br><br>
    To validate my skills, I earned CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications, and most recently passed the AZ-104 exam on June 4th, 2025, becoming a Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator, my proudest achievement so far.
    <br><br>
     I love digging into complex infrastructure, figuring out how everything works, and then finding smart ways to optimize and secure it.
    <br><br>
    Right now, I’m especially focused on growing my Azure expertise and taking on new cloud challenges. If you want to connect feel free to reach out!

<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Personal Life</h3>
<p>
  I recently moved to the Madison area in Wisconsin, and so far I'm loving being back in the Midwest and exploring the surrounding areas.
  Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my family and lady, playing video games, and exploring the outdoors. 
  I’m also a big fan of sci-fi movies and books, working on finishing the last book in the Dune series right now.
  I disc golf a lot as well, playing with friends and family whenever I can.

      <h2>About the Azure Lab</h2>
      <p>This lab is deployed using Azure App Services, blob storage, Azure functions, Azure DNS and more. To fully embrace the cloud and proper devops practices, I decided to deploy this entire app/site with Terraform.
        I use a CI/CD pipeline connected to my Github to deploy the infrastructure. It's cost-efficient (< $30/month) and overengineered just enough to simulate a production-grade environment.</p>
        Click on the "About the Lab" link in the top section of the site to get a detailed breakdown of the infrastructure and how it all works.

        Note: This is all still a work in progress, so expect changes and improvements over time. I plan to add more features and content as I continue to learn and grow in my Azure journey.
