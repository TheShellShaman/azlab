    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the technical breakdown! This page details how this lab is architected, the Azure services used, and how everything is tied together using Terraform and CI/CD.
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Azure App Service</strong> – Hosts the main website frontend</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong> – Stores static site assets and backend game data</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Functions</strong> – Handles serverless backend logic (like high scores)</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Managed Identity</strong> – Secure resource access (no secrets in code!)</li>
      <li><strong>Azure DNS</strong> – Manages the jacobsazlab.com domain and routing</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> – Automates infrastructure deployment and updates using Terraform</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features & Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully deployed and managed with <strong>Terraform</strong> (Infrastructure as Code)</li>
      <li>Managed Identities for secure, passwordless resource access</li>
      <li>Automated CI/CD pipeline: push to main = deploy infrastructure</li>
      <li>Custom domain (jacobsazlab.com) managed by Azure DNS, registrar is squarespace</li>
      <li>Low monthly cost (< $30/month, intentionally overengineered for learning)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Terraform to Azure CI/CD Flow</h4>
    <p>
            This diagram illustrates how the CI/CD pipeline works to push out my infrastructure changes to Azure using Terraform.
            Initially, the changes are made on my local machine with vscode.
            Once I have the Terraform where I want it and think it is ready to be pushed live, I run a terraform plan to see what changes will be made, and to verify syntax.
            When this happnes, my account reaches out to the storage account that is hosting the terraform state file to perform the TF plan.
            Access is allowed through RBAC permissions that I have setup for the storage account.
            Once I am happy with the terraform plan, I push the changes to my GitHub repo.
            The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered, which runs the Terraform apply command against Azure Environment.
            Github Actions uses RBAC permissions given to the GitHub Actions service principal to access the Azure resources and apply the changes.

    <h3>More Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Service</strong>: Linux B1, runs the public web site. Secure settings, custom domain, HTTPS enforced.</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Function</strong>: Used for backend logic like saving and reading snake game high scores. Uses managed identity to access storage. (still working on this)</li>
      <li><strong>CI/CD</strong>: GitHub Actions handles all Terraform deployments and code pushes, with RBAC and state management handled securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Source Code & Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      All code and Terraform for this project is public:  
      <a href="https://github.com/TheShellShaman/azlab" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What’s Next? I'm going to keep adding diagrams on information flow and keep adding complexity. (logging, pushing azure app data to website, making snake game better, etc)</h
