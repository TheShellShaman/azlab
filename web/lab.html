    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the technical breakdown! This page details how this lab is architected, the Azure services used, and how everything is tied together using Terraform and CI/CD.

        <h4>Terraform to Azure CI/CD Flow</h4>
        <p>
          This diagram illustrates how the CI/CD pipeline works to push out my infrastructure changes to Azure using Terraform.
          Initially, the changes are made on my local machine with VSCode.
          Once I have the Terraform where I want it and think it is ready to be pushed live, I run a terraform plan to see what changes will be made, and to verify syntax.
          When this happens, my account reaches out to the storage account that is hosting the terraform state file to perform the TF plan.
          Access is allowed through RBAC permissions that I have setup for the storage account.
          Once I am happy with the terraform plan, I push the changes to my GitHub repo.
          The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered, which runs the Terraform apply command against Azure Environment.
          GitHub Actions uses RBAC permissions given to the GitHub Actions service principal to access the Azure resources and apply the changes.
